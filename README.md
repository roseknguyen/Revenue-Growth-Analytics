# Revenue Growth Analytics

Welcome to my Business Analytics project! I developed a relational database for a digital marketing company and utilized SQL and R to analyze and explore their revenue growth opportunities. The data is hypothetical, assuming that their clients are S&P 500 companies.

**PROJECT BACKGROUND:**

This digital marketing company provides three primary marketing services: SEO (Search Engine Optimization), PPC (Pay-Per-Click Google Ads), and Web Design. Each of these services is treated as an individual project, and a client can engage in up to three distinct projects, one for each service (SEO, PPC, Web Design).

The objective is to explore and analyze their clients' and projects' data, and ultimately identify opportunities for increasing revenue.

**RESULT SUMMARY:**

To boost revenue, the digital marketing company can leverage the following three opportunities:

**Opportunity 1: Increase Customers**

* There are six industries with a client base below the average. By concentrating on acquiring more clients in these industries to meet the average, they can onboard 101 new clients, corresponding to 101 to 303 new projects.


**Opportunity 2: Increase Projects for Existing Clients**

* There are 114 current clients never had an SEO project, 189 clients never had a PPC project, 58 clients who have never engaged in a Web Design project, and 142 existing clients who may now require a web redesign. By capitalizing on their existing client base, they can potentially generate up to a total of 803 new projects

**Opportunity 3: Increase the Scope of the Existing Projects**

* There are 58 projects that have maintained the same scope for 2 to 11 years (never expanded before), and there are 328 projects that haven't expanded again in the last 2 to 11 years (since its last expansion). 

* By concentrating on opportunities to expand these clients, they can generate growth in 484 new projects.

Final Conclusion: 

Considering all three opportunities, by acquiring 101 new clients, initiating 803 new projects, and expanding 484 existing projects, the digital marketing company can substantially grow their revenue.
